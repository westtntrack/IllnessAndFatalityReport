<h1>Report Summary â€“ Illness, Injury and Fatality Report</h1>

<ul>
<li>The report shows that Federal Programs have the highest rate of fatalities, with North Dakota (Federal) having the highest rate at 17.7. Of the states regulated by a State Program, California has the highest number of Injuries/Illnesses, however, Vermont has the highest rate of injuries/illnesses.  The data did not make sense when looking at it as number of years to inspect a workplace, so was looked at as number of inspections. The scatter plot shows outliers that show a low number of fatalities when there was a high number of inspections, and a high fatality number when there was a low number of inspections.</li>

<li>For the Rate of Fatalities, currently the slicer shows data for the opposite of what you click, so would like to change to clicking on state would show state, and federal would show federal. Further analysis on the Injuries and Illnesses would make me ask a couple of questions. Is there a direct connection between inspections and the number of injuries and illnesses, and I would like to build a heat map that shows the areas of the country where the most injuries and illnesses occur to visualize areas of the country. Looking at the number of inspectors with the number of inspections, it seems that 6 states had inspectors that did not do any inspections, with Washington topping the charts with over 60 inspectors that did not do any inspections.</li>
